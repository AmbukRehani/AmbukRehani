üîç I'm a passionate Data Engineer specializing in transforming complex data into actionable insights. With expertise in Python, SQL, and cloud technologies like AWS and Azure, I build robust data pipelines and architectures.

### What I Do
- üìä **Data Pipeline Development**: Crafting efficient, scalable pipelines to handle large datasets.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud-Based Solutions**: Leveraging AWS and Azure for optimized data storage and processing.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Tool Mastery**: Proficient in Spark, Databricks and other data engineering tools.
- ü§ñ **Automation & Optimization**: Streamlining processes to enhance data flow and integrity.

### My Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
1. [Migration-Insights-Understanding-U.S.-Immigration-Dynamics](https://github.com/ambuk/Migration-Insights-Understanding-U.S.-Immigration-Dynamics)): -
- Developed an analytical platform to study US immigration trends using AWS S3 Buckets, Apache Airflow and Apache Spark.
- Introduced AWS EMR clusters to compute data-heavy operations capable of handling 100 times the current data.
- Scheduled Airflow DAG daily to frequently update the data on S3 buckets to be further queried for different analytical Purposes
  **Tech Stack** : (AWS) S3 buckets, Apache Airflow, Apache Spark, AWS EMR clusters, AWS IAM, SQL.

2. [SoundScape Analytics Platform](https://github.com/ambuk/SoundScape-Analytics-Platform):
- Designed an analytics platform for audiophiles who plan to buy/sell headphones using an End-to-End ELT pipeline and analytics dashboard by loading audio products data into AWS Services (S3, Redshift, RDS)
- Utilized Terraform to connect multiple AWS Services and automate the pipeline process and implemented Docker to containerize Airflow Server, scheduler and workers.
- Displayed powerful insights such as consumer preferences, market positioning and product development using Metabase dashboard.
  **Tech Stack** : AWS (S3, Redshift, RDS), Airflow, Terraform, Docker, Metabase

3. [Youtube-User-Comments-Semantic-Analysis](https://github.com/ambuk/Youtube-User-Comments-Semantic-Analysis)
- Built machine learning models in Spark to classify if users are cat or dog owners based on 100k comments on Youtube videos.
- Preprocessed data by removing missing values and labeled part of users based on their comments.
- Processed users' comments via RegexTokenizer and Word2Vec in SparkML.
- Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest models and tuned hyperparameters and selected the best model with 0.85 accuracy based on 5-fold cross-validation.
- Explored topics important to cat and dog owners by plotting WordCloud.
  **Tech Stack** : Apache Spark, Word2Vec, Spark MLlib

4. [University Recommendation System](https://github.com/ambuk/University-Recommendation-System)
- Built a website with JavaScript and Bootstrap to provide top 10 university recommendations as a response to various input parameters from potential students.
- Developed a REST API in Golang and preprocessed Kaggle datasets using Python scripts to set up a visualization framework using Elasticsearch and Kibana.
- Hosted the website on a Kubernetes cluster to ensure fault-tolerance and reliability
 **Tech Stack** : Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Go, Elasticsearch, Kibana


### Continuous Learning
